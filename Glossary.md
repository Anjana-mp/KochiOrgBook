## DID – Decentralized Identifier

DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. Each DID has associated with it one or more public keys created by the DID owner (and the owner holds the corresponding private keys), and one or more endpoints - addresses where messages can be delivered for that identity. A DID can be uniquely resolved (like a URL) to return the the data (public keys and endpoints) associated with the DID.
