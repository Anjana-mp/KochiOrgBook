## ToIP – Trust over IP​ Foundation

It comes under the Linux Founddation. The mission of the ToIP foundation is to simplify and standardize how trust is established online so that everyone can feel safe, 
secure, and private in all of our digital interactions — whether between individuals, businesses, governments, or any “thing” on the Internet of Things.

## DID – Decentralized Identifier

DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority. Each DID has associated with it one or more public keys created 
by the DID owner (and the owner holds the corresponding private keys), and one or more endpoints - addresses where messages can be delivered for that identity. A DID can 
be uniquely resolved (like a URL) to return the the data (public keys and endpoints) associated with the DID.

## Agents and Wallets

With so many DIDs floating around, it's clear that memory and bits of paper are not enough to manage all the DIDs a person creates or receives. Indy uses the term "Agent" 
to mean the software that interacts with other entities, and the term "Wallet" as a data store for the DIDs and related information. For example, a person might have a 
mobile Agent app on their smart devices, while an Organization might have an enterprise Agent running on a Cloud Server. All Agents have a secure Wallet for storing 
identity data.

For those familiar with a Password Manager like 1Password or LastPass, a personal Agent wallet is similar - there is a name for each relationship and associated data. 
However, unlike Password Managers that use things like your copy/paste clipboard for User IDs and Passwords and "screen-scrape" applications and websites, Agents 
communicate directly with Agents to accomplish Identity-related tasks.
