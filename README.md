# KochiOrgBook

KochiOrgBook is a Verifiable Organization Network for the city of Kochi. The objective of this initiative was to enable business entities to avail permits or licenses from Government in a transparent and efficient manner and in the current form it may not be feasible for an ordinary citizen to confirm if these association are valid or not due to chance of forgery of documents and we often trust the documents they present making it quite easy to misguide anyone.

**With KochiOrgBook each association will now be able to present cryptographically encrypted digital credential which has been issued to them from a trusted entity and can be verified by any citizen of Kochi using their mobile wallet app.**

KochiOrgBook is a technology demonstrator to launch a DID (Decentralized Identity) based utility which is compliant with the ToIP (TrustOverIP) standards to enable Trusted digital verification service for various association within the city of Kochi.

In the current sceanrio, for a citizen to avail any service or to prove their eligibility or identity, they have to provide a number of documents. Often the whole process takes time and a lot of effort.

This utility aims to cut down the red tape and improve the overall efficiency of the current processes.
