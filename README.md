# KochiOrgBook

KochiOrgBook is a **Verifiable Organization Network** for the city of Kochi. It is a technology demonstrator to launch a DID based utility compliant with the ToIP standards to enable Trusted digital verification service for various association within the city of Kochi.â€‹

The objective of this initiative was to enable business entities to avail permits or licenses from Government in a transparent and efficient manner and in the current form it may not be feasible for an 
ordinary citizen to confirm if these association are valid or not due to chance of forgery of documents and we often trust the documents they present making it quite easy to misguide anyone.

With KochiOrgBook each association will now be able to present cryptographically encrypted digital credential which has been issued to them from a trusted entity and can 
be verified by any citizen of Kochi using their mobile wallet app.

In the current sceanrio, for a citizen to avail any service or to prove their eligibility or identity, they have to provide a number of documents. Often the whole process 
takes time and a lot of effort.

This utility aims to cut down the red tape and improve the overall efficiency of the current processes.

## Key Use Cases 

1. Medical Practitioners
   
   **Verifiable/Issuing Association - IMA(Kochi Chapter)**

   Nobody can take risks when it comes to health. So, when someone is suffering from a health related issue, he/she will, most probably, consult an experienced and well renowned doctor. We usually ask our friends/relatives for recommendations on a good doctor or visit the highly rated hospital. Sometimes we even consult more than one doctor to get a second opinion regarding one's health issue. This practise can be time consuming and can be tiring as well. There are situations were the treatment should be given on time and in such a situation, this practise should not be followed.

   With KochiOrgBook, doctors will be issued a digital identity about who they are and what their qualification is and a normal citizen can access these informations from their fingertips. With this, an individual can make the best decisions on time and with ease.
