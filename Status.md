# Topics Covered
## ToIp Stack
### _Layer 1_
This layer is mainly for blockchains and distributed ledgers. It is a layer of public utilities for decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
### _Layer 2_
This layer is for peer DID and DID to DID connections and communications.
### _Layer 3_
The purpose of third and fourth layer is to establish human trust between peers, trust between individuals and organizations and the thing with which they interact.
### _Layer 4_
Layer Four is the layer where humans interact with applications in order to engage in trusted interactions that serve a specific business, legal, or social purpose. 
## Verifiable Credentials
Verifiable credentials are cryptographically constructed so that a presentation proves the 4 key attributes of all credentials. The 4 key attributes are:
* Who issued the credential
* The credential was issued to the entity presenting it
* The claims were not tampered
* The credential has not been revoked
When a reciever recieves a presentation from a holder they use the information from a blockchain to perform the cyptographic calculations necessary to prove the 4 attributes.
## SSI (Self Soverign Identifiers)
* The idea that you control your own data.
* No central authority
## Decentralized Identifiers - Private and Public DIDs
Special kind of identifiers that are created by their owner, independent of any central authority.
### Private DIDs
Entities create the DIDs and DIDDocs and then send both directly to the other parties to hold.
### Public DIDs
Widely available
Presented to anyone that is presented with the DID.
## ZKP (Zero Knowledge protocol)
Proving attributes about an entity without exposing all other details about that entity.
## Selective Disclosure
Proving pieces of info without presenting the underlying data.
## Agents and Wallets
Software that you use to process verifiable credentials and DIDs. 
Software that interacts with other entities.
## Hyperledger Indy
Hyperledger Indy is the implementation of distributed ledger. Indy is mainly for storing blockchain elements and provides verifiable credentials. Blockchain is a decentralized source of trust for publicaly available information.

What is on Blockchain?

* Public DIDs
* Issuer's Public key
* Credential Schema

What is not on Blockchain?

* Pairwise DIDs
* Credentials
* Prover
* Private keys
